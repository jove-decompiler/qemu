# Encodings for Neon load/store instructions where the T32 encoding
# is a simple transformation of the A32 encoding.
# More specifically, this file covers instructions where the A32 encoding is
#   0b1111_0100_xxx0_xxxx_xxxx_xxxx_xxxx_xxxx
# and the T32 encoding is
#   0b1111_1001_xxx0_xxxx_xxxx_xxxx_xxxx_xxxx
# This file works on the A32 encoding only; calling code for T32 has to
# transform the insn into the A32 version first.
